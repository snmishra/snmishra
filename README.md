## Hi, I am Satya! 
I am currently CTO at [WayLit](https://www.waylit.com/). This is my personal profile where I contribute to open-source software and have a few odd-ball projects

- My personal [blog](https://snmishra.wordpress.com/)
- Find me on <a rel="&#006d;&#0065;" href="https://mas.to/@satya">Mastodon</a>

My favored languages are Python and TypeScript. In the past, I have programmed in [SKILL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_SKILL) and [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk/)
